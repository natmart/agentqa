## Post

**Excited to announce: AgentQA is now in beta.**

Over the past year, I've watched AI coding assistants transform how teams write software. Cursor, Copilot, Claude — they're incredible.

But I've also noticed a growing problem:

**The code is getting written faster. The bugs are getting caught slower.**

Every engineering leader I talk to says the same thing: "AI speeds up development, but now we spend more time reviewing and testing."

The bottleneck shifted. QA hasn't caught up.

That's why we built AgentQA.

**What it is:**
Autonomous testing agents that specifically catch what AI coding assistants miss — the edge cases, the subtle bugs, the "it works on my machine" issues.

**How it works:**
→ Connect your GitHub repo (2 minutes)
→ AgentQA watches your PRs
→ Automatically generates edge case tests
→ Catches bugs before production

**Who it's for:**
Fast-moving teams (20-50 people) using TypeScript/JavaScript and AI coding tools. Teams that ship daily but worry about quality.

**What we're looking for:**
10 beta partners who want to help us build the future of QA.

Free setup. Hands-on support. Your feedback shapes the product.

If this sounds like your team, DM me or comment below.

Let's build something great together.

## Alternative Hooks

**Option A (Question lead):**
"How is your team handling QA for AI-generated code?"

I've asked this question to 30+ engineering leaders. The answers were... concerning.

**Option B (Contrarian):**
Unpopular opinion: AI coding assistants are creating more bugs, not fewer.

Not because the AI is bad. Because we're not testing it properly.

**Option C (Story lead):**
Last month, an AI-generated function took down our staging environment.

The code looked perfect. It passed our tests. But there was an edge case nobody considered.

That's when I realized: we need a new approach to QA.
