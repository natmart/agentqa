We've been using AI to write code for a year.

But who's testing the AI's code?

Introducing AgentQA — autonomous testing agents that catch what Cursor, Copilot, and Claude miss.

Here's why we built it 🧵

The problem:

AI coding assistants are incredible at generating code fast.

But they're also incredible at generating subtle bugs:
- Off-by-one errors in loops
- Null checks that don't exist
- Edge cases the AI never considered

Sound familiar?

We talked to 30+ engineering teams.

Every single one said the same thing:

"AI speeds up writing code, but now we spend MORE time reviewing it."

The bottleneck shifted from writing → reviewing.

The old QA playbook doesn't work anymore.

- Manual testing? Can't keep up
- Traditional test suites? Don't catch AI-specific bugs
- Code review? Engineers are drowning in PRs

You need QA that moves at AI speed.

Enter AgentQA.

It's an autonomous agent that:
✓ Watches your PRs for AI-generated patterns
✓ Generates edge case tests automatically
✓ Catches bugs before they hit production
✓ Learns from your codebase over time

How it works:

1. Connect your GitHub repo (takes 2 min)
2. AgentQA analyzes your codebase
3. On every PR, it generates targeted tests
4. You get a report of potential issues

No config files. No maintenance. It just works.

Early results:

One team found 12 edge case bugs in their first week.

Another caught a race condition that would've taken down their API.

Average setup time: 8 minutes.
