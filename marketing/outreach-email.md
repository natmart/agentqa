## Email Body

**Subject:** Quick question about your QA process

Hi {{first_name}},

I noticed {{company}} is building with TypeScript — and based on your GitHub activity, you're shipping fast. That's awesome.

Quick question: how are you handling QA for AI-generated code?

We've been talking to teams your size and hearing the same thing: Cursor/Copilot/Claude speed up development, but the code still needs review. PRs pile up. Bugs slip through. Nobody has time to babysit the AI.

We're building **AgentQA** — autonomous testing agents that catch what AI coding assistants miss. Think of it as QA that scales with your AI-assisted development speed.

**What it does:**
- Watches PRs for AI-generated code patterns
- Automatically generates edge case tests
- Catches the "it works on my machine" bugs before production
- Integrates in 10 minutes (GitHub Action)

We're taking 10 beta teams this month. Setup is free, takes <15 min, and we'll personally help you configure it.

Worth a 15-minute call to see if it fits?

Best,
{{your_name}}

P.S. — We found 3 edge case bugs in our own AI-generated code last week. Happy to share what we learned.

## Follow-up (Day 3)

**Subject:** Re: Quick question about your QA process

Hey {{first_name}},

Following up — I know you're busy.

One thing I forgot to mention: we're specifically looking for teams using TypeScript + AI coding tools. Based on {{company}}'s stack, you'd be a great fit for early feedback.

No pressure, but if QA is a pain point, I'd love 15 minutes to show you what we're building.

Calendly: {{calendly_link}}

## Follow-up (Day 7)

**Subject:** Last one, promise

{{first_name}} — 

Not trying to spam you. Just genuinely think AgentQA could save your team time.

If timing's bad, no worries. If you ever want to chat about AI + QA challenges, I'm around.

Cheers,
{{your_name}}

## Personalization Notes

Research before sending:
1. Check their GitHub for recent TypeScript repos
2. Look for mentions of Cursor/Copilot/AI tools in their commits or docs
3. Find a specific feature they shipped recently to reference
4. Check if they've tweeted about testing/QA pain points
