## Outreach Strategy

4. **Company "About" pages:** Often list team

### Personalization Research
For each company, before reaching out:
- [ ] Check recent GitHub activity (what are they building?)
- [ ] Look for any public mentions of testing/QA challenges
- [ ] Find if they use AI coding tools (check commits, tweets)
- [ ] Identify specific TypeScript repos to reference

### Outreach Order
1. Start with Tier 1 — highest conversion probability
2. Space outreach: 2-3 companies per day max
3. Follow up consistently (day 3, day 7)
